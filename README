= DISCLAIMER

This software can cause severe damage to your Timex Data Link USB watch.  Use
at your own risk.

Be prepared to do hard-reset!


= INTRODUCTION

libdlusb is a library used to communicate with the Timex Data Link USB watch on
various UN*X operating systems.  The library can be built with two USB
libraries: libusb (OS-independent USB library) and usbhid (USB HID library for
*BSD).

The communication protocol was implemented based on "Data Link USB
Communication Protocol and Database Design Guide," which is distributed by
Timex Corporation.

= COMPILATION

 = libusb

1. Create Makefile.  The configure script generates Makefile for libusb support
   by default:

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME

2. Build the library and test programs:

   make

3. Install programs under $HOME/bin (${prefix}/bin):

   make install

4. Edit $HOME/.dlusbrc

Now you have libdlusb.a and several test programs.  If you want a shared
library, add --enable-shared option to configure (./configure --enable-shared)
and run make.

NOTE: Under *BSD, install the libusb port from /usr/ports/devel/libusb and
unload the uhid kernel module or disable it from the kernel config.


 = usbhid

This applies only to *BSD.

1. As root, you need to add the following lines into the kernel config
   (/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/MYKERNEL) to support USB and HID:

   device	uhci
   device	ohci
   device	ehci
   device	usb
   device	ugen
   device	uhid

2. Recompile the kernel and reboot:

   cd /usr/src
   make kernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL
   reboot

3. Configure libdlusb with usbhid support:

   ./configure --with-usbhid --prefix=$HOME

4. Build the library and test programs:

   make

5. Install programs under $HOME/bin (${prefix}/bin):

   make install

6. Edit $HOME/.dlusbrc

7. Use /dev/uhid0 for the device file.  If it doesn't work, you can see which
   file is linked with the watch by tailing /var/log/message while
   attaching/detaching the watch (tail -f /var/log/message).

That's it!  Add --enable-shared option to configure (./configure --with-usbhid
--enable-shared) to build a shared library.

NOTE: When you switch between the two USB libraries, make sure to delete an old
library (make clean; rm -f libdlusb.*; ./configure ...).
